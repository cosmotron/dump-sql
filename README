DUMP-SQL 0.1

About:
        dump-sql parses a tcpdump packet capture file and converts each packet
        into a series of SQL rows.  It can connect to a MySQL database and send
        insert statements or dump them to a file if the database is not
        accessible remotely.

        Since this was written for a project, it is a bit underfeatured.  For
        instance, the only transport layer protocol it supports is TCP, actual
        packet payloads are ignored, and it can only connect to MySQL
        specifically.

        It separates each packet's ethernet, ip, and tcp headers into tables
        of the same names.  Each table's schema matches the appropriate
        header's structure plus an extra column to identify the packet.  This
        is particularly helpful if you would like to join the tables.

Prerequisites:
        dump-sql was built using the following libraries:
        - libpcap 1.0.0
        - MySQL 5.1.37

Building:
        To build dump-sql, simply run: make

Usage:
        Before running, make sure you create a database that uses the schema as
        defined by schema.sql, as this is what the program is expecting the
        layout to be.

        Running ./dump-sql with no arguments will produce a small help output.
